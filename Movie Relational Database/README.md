# Overview

I am creating a program that allows fo the insertion, updating, and deletion of movies in a database.

I wrote software that will provide a short menu to choose from where you then can input number 1-8 to choose you options which range from
displaying the movies in the database to inserting more.

My purpose of this program is increase my ability to use SQL alongside Python programming

# Relational Database

The Relational database I am using includes a movie and genre table that are inner joined to provide correlation between the data in both

The tables are simple in creation an are meant ot be visual aids to help with sorting through movies in a database

# Development Environment

The tool I am using to make this program work is SQLITE which allows for correlation between SQL and other programming languages

I am using Python to program this
